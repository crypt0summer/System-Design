### 1. Architecture Main Theories
#### 1-1 [Basic Theories for scalability](https://github.com/crypt0summer/System-Design/blob/main/1_MainTheories/1_1_BasicTheories/0_Scalability.md)
0. Why Scalability?
1. Vertical to Horizontal
2. Load Balancing and Proxies
3. Caching
4. Networking
5. Communication Protocols(APIs)
6. Storage


#### 1-2 [High-level Trade-offs](https://github.com/crypt0summer/System-Design/blob/main/1_MainTheories/1_2_High-level_Trade-offs/0_TradeOffs.md)
- Performance vs scalability
- Latency vs throughput
- Availability vs consistency


### 2. Case Studies
Scalability, API, Tech Stack, Security, Handling Transactions, High Availability and Disaster Recovery.
- Circle
- Stripe
- Paypal

### 3. Into the Specific Technologies
- DB : Relational(PostgreSQL, MySQL) VS NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra)
- Security : 
  - Encryption: Techniques, best practices.  
  - Authentication: OAuth, JWT.  
  - Compliance: PCI DSS standards.  

### 4. Practical Excercises
- Create small projects or code snippets using the technologies studied.
